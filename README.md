# SlitherIntoPython_DiscordBot

1/5/21 - Did my first upload to Github. My initial goal with this discord bot was to be a community grown bot so that we all could learn together.
That's why there ton's of descriptions in the code...trying to explain what each interaction does with Discord.

Using the discord.py library on Python 3.5
